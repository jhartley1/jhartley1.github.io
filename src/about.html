title: About me
---

<p>I'm a passionate engineer, leader, and software architect. I'm interested in statistics, distributed systems, design
    (product and system),
    incremental delivery, and complexity reduction.</p>

<p>I believe that building strong software systems starts with building strong teams and strong teams don't need ivory
    tower software architects. </p>
