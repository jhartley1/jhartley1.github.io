        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">About me</h2>

        <p class="m-1">I'm a passionate engineer, leader, and software architect. I'm interested in building useful
            products as simply
            as possible, their incremental delivery, design (product and system), data analysis, and statistics.</p>

        <p class="m-1">I believe that building strong software systems starts with building strong teams and strong
            teams don't need
            ivory
            tower software architects. </p>

        <p>I live in Southern New Hampshire with my wife, our two dogs, and our horse.</p>

        <p>
            I joined as the first engineer and built a platform for 2FA based on 'ambient authentication'. User
            approvals for
            authentication built an
            accompanying signature of their local environment that could be compared on the machine initiating
            login, eventually
            no
            longer requiring explicit confirmation.
            We believed we could use the phone's gyroscope to identify a user and that we could compare signals
            in the
            environment
            like WiFi, Bluetooth, and temperature
            across the initiating machine and the user's phone.
        </p>

        <p>
            In practice, our system used a mobile application as the second factor and we would automatically
            approve 2FA
            requests
            when the mobile device was in a known location. Known locations were accumulated through previous
            approvals in the
            same
            place using a clustering algorithm.

        <p>At Carbon Black (now VMWare Carbon Black), I worked in R&D focused on virtual machine
            introspection, ML-based malware
            classification,
            and decentralization of the Carbon Black sensor.</p>

        <h4 class="font-bold">Owl</h4>
        <p>I built Owl, a project for locating WiFi devices with low-touch deployment using a
            Raspberry PI mesh network and
            low-cost USB WiFi adapters set to promiscuous mode.
            The first version was written in Python and a second version followed in Go.</p>

            <li>At Lambent's old office (pre-covid, then known as Armored Things), the bathrooms weren't visible from
                most
                desks.
                It
                was a common occurrence to arrive at the bathroom with both bathrooms occupied or seemingly occupied
                with
                the
                door
                shut
                and the room empty. I built a bathroom sensor which used a magnetic contact sensor alongside a motion
                sensor
                to
                detect
                bathroom occupancy and light up some indicator lights visible in the hallway.</li>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-3">Personal interests</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Listening to music: I like jazz, bluegrass, and progressive bluegrass. I'm also into more “mainstream”
                electronic music like house and trace.</li>
            <li>Musical performance, composition, and improvisation: I play Guitar, primarily acoustic, and spend a
                large
                amount
                of
                time practicing improvisation with a focus on solo playing. I like the idea of playing with others but
                my
                actions
                prove
                otherwise.</li>
            <li>Hiking: I'd like to finish the NH 4K footers in the coming decade</li>
            <li>Snowboarding</li>
            <li>
                I've spent time learning the game of Go, though I'm still very much a beginner (20s+ kyu)
            </li>
            <li>
                Organic gardening and the soil food web

            </li>
            <li>
                Video games, largely indie games. I like puzzle games (Zachtronics, Strange Horticulture, The Case of
                the
                Golden
                Idol), games with complex emergent systems
                (Barotrauma, Dwarf Fortress), factory and building (Factorio, shapez, Satisfactory), roguelikes (Risk of
                Rain,
                Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon), souls-like (Hollow Knight, Tunic, Elden Ring, Sekiro, Bloodborne)
                possible?
            </li>
            <li>
                Game development and game design: what makes a game fun? How does the design work? How did
                implementation
                make it
                possible?
            </li>
            <li>
                Coffee and espresso: I currently use a Breville Bambino Plus and a Niche Zero though I'm eying a
                Gagguino
                setup.

            </li>
            <li>
                Ergonomic split keyboards: I've been a long time Ergodox EZ user and I've recently acquired a Voyager
            </li>
