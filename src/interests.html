- Listening to music: I’m interested in “mainstream” electronic music and more experimental projects, jazz, bluegrass,
and progressive bluegrass
- Musical performance, composition, and improvisation: I play Guitar, primarily acoustic, and spend a large amount of
time practicing improvisation with a focus on solo playing. I like the idea of playing with others but my actions prove
otherwise.
- Embedded hardware and IoT
- At Lambent’s old office (pre-covid, then known as Armored Things), the bathrooms weren’t visible from most desks. It
was a common occurrence to arrive at the bathroom with both bathrooms occupied or seemingly occupied with the door shut
and the room empty. I built a bathroom sensor which used a magnetic contact sensor alongside a motion sensor to detect
bathroom occupancy and light up some indicator lights visible in the hallway.
- Environmental monitoring and control systems for gardening
- I’ve spent time learning the game of Go, though I’m still very much a beginner (20s+ kyu)
- Organic gardening and the soil food web
- Video games, largely indie games. I like puzzle games (Zachtronics, Strange Horticulture, The Case of the Golden Idol), games with complex emergent systems
(Barotrauma, Dwarf Fortress), factory and building (Factorio, shapez, Satisfactory), roguelikes (Risk of Rain, Binding
of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon), souls-like (Hollow Knight, Tunic, Elden Ring, Sekiro, Bloodborne)
- Game development and game design: what makes a game fun? How does the design work? How did implementation make it
possible?
- Data intensive systems
- Distributed systems: Akka, distributed databases like Cassandra
- Streaming and streaming approaches to problems
- Event driven systems
- Bayesian statistics and probabilistic reasoning
- Functional and typed functional programming languages
- Reverse engineering, binary analysis, low level software. IDA pro.
- Coffee and espresso: I currently use a Breville Bambino Plus and a Niche Zero though I’m eying a Gagguino setup.
- I admire Lisps, in particular Clojure, though I’m an infrequent user nowadays
- Building programming languages and interpreters
- Ergonomic split keyboards: I’ve been a long time Ergodox EZ user and I’ve recently acquired a Voyager
