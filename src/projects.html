<h2>Lambent</h2>

<h2>Latch Mobile</h2>

<h2>Locurity</h2>
<p>
    I joined as the first engineer and built a platform for 2FA based on 'ambient authentication'. User approvals for
    authentication built an
    accompanying signature of their local environment that could be compared on the machine initiating login, eventually
    no
    longer requiring explicit confirmation.
    We believed we could use the phone's gyroscope to identify a user and that we could compare signals in the
    environment
    like WiFi, Bluetooth, and temperature
    across the initiating machine and the user's phone.
</p>

<p>
    In practice, our system used a mobile application as the second factor and we would automatically approve 2FA
    requests
    when the mobile device was in a known location. Known locations were accumulated through previous approvals in the
    same
    place using a clustering algorithm.

<h2>Carbon Black</h2>
<p>At Carbon Black (now VMWare Carbon Black), I worked in R&D focused on virtual machine introspection, ML-based malware
    classification,
    and decentralization of the Carbon Black sensor.</p>

<h2>Owl</h2>
<p>I built Owl, a project for locating WiFi devices with low-touch deployment using a Raspberry PI mesh network and
    low-cost USB WiFi adapters set to promiscuous mode.
    The first version was written in Python and a second version followed in Go.</p>

<h2>NUCAC and GCTO</h2>
